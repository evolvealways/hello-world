# hello-world
First Github Repository

I am completely new to coding, and the coding community. Learning to code is part of my commitment to myself to learn new skills!  I have no grand delusions of ruling the world, but I would like to gain proficiency and see where it takes me.  I am excited to connect, learn, and create more value than I consume.
